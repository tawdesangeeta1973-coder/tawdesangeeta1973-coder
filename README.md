My long-term goal is to develop the mindset required for responsible security leadership.

## Current learning focus

- Monitoring and logging
- Honeypots and attack pattern observation
- Security ethics

## Principles I follow
- Defense over offense
- Ethics before experimentation
- Clarity over hype## Hi there
